# Python_Metadata
üêç Record and compare Python code metadata statistics.
#

Convert short Python codes into .txt files and store them inside a folder named "Converted". Log and compare file metadata from the "Converted" folder. This file metadata is stored as .txt files inside a folder named "Imported". The "Imported" folder files are scanned and filtered. 

Additional .txt metafiles are created inside a folder named "Metadata" for every data file inside the "Imported" folder. 

New file data added to the "Converted" folder could be imported, scanned, sorted and compared against all files in the "Metadata" folder. Additional .txt metafiles are created inside the "Metadata" folder for each newly created file inside the "Converted" folder.

All of the metafiles inside the "Metadata" folder are exported for data analysis and visualization.
